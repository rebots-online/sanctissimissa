# Early App Development History

## 2014 Android App Store Products

During 2014, while still serving as an altar server, initial attempts were made to create Catholic-themed applications for the Android platform. These early efforts represent the first steps toward what would eventually evolve into the SanctissiMissa project.

### "Hello, Word" App

The "Hello, Word" app was a play on the traditional programmer's "Hello, World" first program, but with a focus on scripture and the Word of God. This early application likely served as:

- A learning experience for Android development
- An introduction to working with religious texts in a digital format
- A simple way to display daily scripture readings or reflections

The name cleverly combined programming tradition with Catholic focus, suggesting an app that introduced users to scripture in an accessible way.

### "St. Android" App

The "St. Android" app represented a more direct attempt to create a Catholic resource on the Android platform. This application may have included:

- Information about saints and their feast days
- A Catholic calendar of celebrations
- Basic prayers and devotions
- Simple Catholic references

The humorous name "St. Android" showed a willingness to bring together modern technology and traditional Catholic devotion in an approachable way. The name cleverly resembles "St. Andrew" (one of the Apostles), creating a multilayered wordplay that connects modern technology with Catholic tradition.

## Historical Context

These early applications were developed during a time of personal significance:

- Created while actively serving at the altar
- Developed during a period described as "swerving" - possibly indicating a time of personal challenge or spiritual exploration
- Represented early attempts to connect technology with faith
- Served as precursors to the more comprehensive SanctissiMissa project

## Relevance to Current Project

These early applications provide valuable historical context for the SanctissiMissa project:

1. **Demonstrated Early Interest**: Shows a longstanding interest in creating digital tools for Catholic practice
2. **Learning Experience**: The technical and content lessons from these early apps can inform current development
3. **Personal Connection**: Ties the current project to personal history as an altar server
4. **Evolution of Vision**: Allows us to see how the vision for Catholic apps has evolved from simple beginnings to the comprehensive platform now planned

## Potential Integration

Elements from these early applications could be incorporated into the SanctissiMissa project:

- Saints information and feast days could be integrated into the liturgical calendar
- Any successful UI/UX elements that worked well for users
- Content that was particularly well-received
- Lessons learned about what Catholic app users find most valuable

These early applications represent important stepping stones in the journey toward creating a comprehensive, traditional Catholic liturgical platform.
