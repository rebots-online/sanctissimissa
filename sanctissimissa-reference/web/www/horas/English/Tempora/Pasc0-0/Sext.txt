[Hymnus]
The dawn was purpling over the sky,
with alleluias the air was ringing,
the world triumphant seemed to cry,
all bounds of earth in music singing.

[Psalmi]
The Lord reigns, he is robed in majesty
Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth
O God, you are my God, earnestly I seek you

[Capitulum]
!Rom 6:9-10
v. Christ, rising again from the dead, dieth now no more, death shall no more have dominion over him. For in that he died to sin, he died once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.

[Lectio1]
Christ is risen from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.
