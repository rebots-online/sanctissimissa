# Sanctissi-Missa - Updated Implementation Checklist (2025-03-27)

(C)2025 Robin L. M. Cheung, MBA. All rights reserved.

## Overview

This document consolidates the existing checklists and the latest project status as of March 27, 2025. It merges tasks from:
- **CHECKLIST-2025-02-27.md**, which outlined an 8-hour sprint on Feb 27, 2025
- **CHECKLIST.md**, our longer-term project management document
- Additional notes from ROADMAP.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and the knowledge graph

The goal is to ensure no placeholders remain falsely marked as completed. We confirm that each `[X]` or `[/]` item truly has implemented code or documentation. If not, the item is reverted to `[ ]` with new tasks or justification.

---

## Status Key

- `[ ]` - Not yet begun / Placeholder
- `[/]` - Started but incomplete
- `[X]` - Completed but not thoroughly tested
- `✅` - Tested and complete

---
