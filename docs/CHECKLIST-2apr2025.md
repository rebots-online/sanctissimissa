# Sanctissi-Missa - Reconciled Implementation Checklist (2025-04-02)

(C)2025 Robin L. M. Cheung, MBA. All rights reserved.

## Overview

This document provides a reconciled checklist for the Sanctissi-Missa project as of April 2, 2025. It uses the detailed structure from the base `CHECKLIST.md` and critically evaluates the status claims made in `CHECKLIST-27mar2025.md` against the project's core documentation (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`).

**Note for April 2 Review:** This checklist aims to provide a more realistic assessment of project status, particularly regarding items previously marked `✅`. Annotations (`<!-- ... -->`) explain status changes or highlight areas needing verification against documented standards and architecture before being considered truly complete. CI/CD tasks are marked as deferred based on current priorities.

## Status Key

- `[ ]` - Not yet begun / Placeholder
- `[/]` - Started but incomplete
- `[X]` - Completed but not thoroughly tested / Needs verification against standards
- `✅` - Tested and complete according to all documented standards
