# Z-Fold Device Optimizations

## Overview

This document outlines the optimizations implemented for Samsung Z-Fold devices in the Sanctissi Missa app. The optimizations are designed to enhance the user experience by taking advantage of the unique form factor of foldable devices.

## Device Detection

The app detects foldable devices and their current state (folded/unfolded) through the following mechanisms:

- **Device Type Detection**: Uses a combination of screen size, aspect ratio, and device model information to identify foldable devices.
- **Fold State Detection**: Monitors dimension changes to determine when the device is folded or unfolded.
- **Event Listeners**: Listens for layout changes to adapt the UI in real-time when the user folds or unfolds the device.
- **Manufacturer & Model Detection**: Identifies specific Samsung Z-Fold models to enable device-specific optimizations.

## UI Optimizations

The app's UI automatically adapts based on the fold state of the device:

### Folded State (Phone Mode)
- Standard phone layout with vertically scrolling content
- Optimized touch targets for smaller screen
- Single column layout for all content
- Focused content views with minimal distractions

### Unfolded State (Tablet Mode)
- Expanded layouts with multi-pane views
- Side-by-side content when appropriate
- Larger typography with optimized reading experience
- Enhanced information density with more content visible simultaneously
- Tabular data layouts for appropriate content

### Responsive Components
- `FoldableLayout`: Core component implementing efficient fold-aware layouts
  - Single shouldShowUnfolded() calculation to prevent recalculation
  - Direct boolean returns for performance
  - Styled components defined outside render for consistent references
  - Automatic handling of forced fold states for testing
- `SearchBar` component adapts its width and position based on fold state
- `LiturgicalText` component adjusts font size and padding based on available screen space
- Modals and dialogs adapt width and positioning based on fold state
- Touch targets are adjusted for optimal interaction in each state

## Performance Optimizations

Several performance optimizations have been implemented to take advantage of the increased computational power and screen real estate of unfolded devices:

### Adaptive Preloading
- **Unfolded State**: More aggressive content preloading with higher concurrency
- **Folded State**: Conservative preloading to preserve battery and minimize memory usage

### Memory Management
- Optimized cache storage strategies based on fold state
- Smart content retention policies that keep more content in memory when unfolded
- Background cleanup operations when transitioning between fold states

### Rendering Optimizations
- Utilizes multiple concurrent rendering operations in unfolded state
- Prioritization of content based on visibility and importance
- Background prerendering of liturgical texts for upcoming days

## Testing Utilities

To facilitate development and testing of fold-aware features, the following utilities have been implemented:

### FoldStateTester
- Allows simulation of fold/unfold events during development
- Provides diagnostics on current device detection and state
- Simulates different device types for comprehensive testing

### DeviceDebug Screen
- Interactive testing interface for fold state simulations
- Visualizes current device detection information
- Provides utilities for testing preloading and cache strategies
- Allows manual triggering of fold state transitions

## Implementation Details

  - Determines device type and fold state
  - Provides event listeners for fold state changes

- **DataManager**: Adapts data loading strategies based on device capabilities
  - Adjusts preloading aggressiveness based on fold state
  - Manages storage optimization for different device states
  - Controls concurrency of data loading operations

- **PrerenderedContent**: Handles caching and preloading of liturgical content
