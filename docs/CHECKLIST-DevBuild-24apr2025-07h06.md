## Development Tasks

### Priority Task: SQLite Implementation

- [x] Implement SQLite data storage
  - [x] Add SQLite dependencies to the project
  - [x] Create SQLite database schema (defined in SQLITE-IMPLEMENTATION-24apr2025-08h15.md)
  - [x] Create import script to populate SQLite database during build
  - [x] Implement SQLite data access service
  - [x] Update application to use SQLite instead of IndexedDB
  - [x] Package pre-populated SQLite database with the application
  - [x] Document SQLite implementation plan

### Web Application Core (After SQLite Implementation)

- [x] Update application to use SQLite
  - [x] Implement SQLite data access service
  - [x] Update components to use SQLite instead of IndexedDB
  - [x] Remove IndexedDB implementation
  - [x] Test application with SQLite database
  - [x] Create standalone SQLite demo as a reference implementation
  - [x] Create new branch for SQLite implementation

- [x] Optimize application startup

  - [x] Implement proper liturgical calendar calculations
  - [ ] Add complete Mass texts for major feasts
  - [ ] Add complete Office texts for major feasts

- [ ] Build Mass rendering engine
  - [ ] Design component architecture for Mass texts
  - [ ] Implement proper rendering of Latin and English texts
  - [ ] Add support for rubrics and formatting
  - [ ] Implement proper handling of propers and ordinary
  - [ ] Add navigation between parts of the Mass

- [ ] Build Divine Office rendering engine
  - [ ] Design component architecture for Office texts
  - [ ] Implement proper rendering of psalms and readings
  - [ ] Add support for antiphons and responses
  - [ ] Implement proper handling of hours
  - [ ] Add navigation between parts of the Office

- [ ] Rebuild main application with SQLite
  - [x] Create standalone SQLite demo as a reference implementation
  - [ ] Rebuild main application using the SQLite demo as a reference
  - [ ] Test rebuilt application
  - [x] Add error handling for SQLite database loading failures
  - [ ] Measure and optimize startup performance

- [ ] Fix routing and navigation
  - [ ] Ensure all routes work correctly with HashRouter
  - [ ] Test deep linking to specific pages
  - [ ] Implement proper navigation between pages
  - [ ] Add breadcrumb navigation for better user experience

### User Interface

- [ ] Implement responsive design
  - [ ] Test on various screen sizes
  - [ ] Ensure mobile-friendly layout
  - [ ] Optimize for tablet devices
  - [ ] Add print styles for printable content

- [ ] Enhance accessibility
  - [ ] Add proper ARIA attributes
  - [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation works
  - [ ] Test with screen readers
  - [ ] Implement high contrast mode

### Testing and Deployment

- [ ] Implement automated testing
  - [ ] Set up Jest for unit testing
  - [ ] Create basic test suite for core functionality
  - [ ] Implement end-to-end tests with Cypress
  - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

- [ ] Prepare for deployment
  - [ ] Create production build
  - [ ] Test production build locally
  - [ ] Document deployment process
  - [ ] Create deployment scripts

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] SQLite database is properly packaged with the application
- [ ] SQLite data access works correctly
- [ ] Application startup is fast and reliable
- [ ] All pages render correctly with data from SQLite
- [ ] Navigation works as expected
- [ ] Responsive design works on all target devices
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are met
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Production build works correctly
- [ ] Application works offline (no reference files needed)

## Notes

- Implementing SQLite data storage is now the highest priority as everything else depends on it
- This approach will eliminate the need for runtime data import and reference file loading
- The pre-populated SQLite database will be packaged with the application
- After SQLite implementation, we can remove all code related to reference file loading and runtime data import
- The application will work offline without requiring reference files
- Focus on getting a stable development build before adding new features
- Document all changes and decisions for future reference
- Consider adding a database versioning mechanism for future updates
