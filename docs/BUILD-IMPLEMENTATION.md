# Development Build Implementation

This document serves as a reference and semaphore for the implementation of the development build process for Sanctissi-Missa. It documents what has been implemented as of April 6, 2025.

## Implementation Status

The development build process has been implemented with the following components:

### 1. Build Configuration

- Updated `eas.json` with enhanced development profile configuration
- Added caching for faster builds
- Set environment variables specific to development builds

### 2. Build Scripts

- Created `scripts/build-dev.sh` for automating the build process
- Created `scripts/verify-dev-build.sh` for verifying build functionality
- Added convenience scripts to `package.json` for running these scripts

### 3. Documentation

- Created comprehensive `BUILD.md` documenting the build process
- Updated `CHECKLIST-6apr2025.md` to track build implementation progress

## Usage Instructions

To create a development build:

```bash
# Option 1: Using the build script (recommended)
npm run build:dev:script

# Option 2: Using EAS CLI directly
npm run build:dev
```

To verify a development build after installation:

```bash
npm run verify:dev:build
```

## Next Steps

- Test the development build on actual devices
- Create automated testing for builds
- Document common issues and solutions
- Extend build system to include more automated checks

## Future Considerations

- Implement CI/CD pipeline integration when ready
- Add automated testing as part of the build process
- Explore more granular build variants (e.g., debug, staging, etc.)
