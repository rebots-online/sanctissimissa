# SanctissiMissa Web Implementation Checklist - April 7, 2025

## Overview

This checklist outlines the specific tasks needed to fix the data import process and create a working development build of the SanctissiMissa web application.

## Status Key

- `[ ]` - Not yet begun
- `[/]` - Started but not complete
- `[X]` - Completed but not thoroughly tested
- `✅` - Tested and complete

## Data Import Process Improvement

### Analysis
- [✅] Identify the issue with the current import process
- [✅] Review the existing import implementation in main.tsx
- [✅] Examine the directImport.ts script functionality

### Implementation
- [✅] Modify main.tsx to use directImport instead of redirecting to import.html
- [✅] Add a loading indicator during the import process
- [✅] Implement a more robust check to prevent repeated import attempts
- [✅] Add a bypass mechanism for development and testing

### Testing
- [ ] Verify the import process works on first load
- [ ] Confirm subsequent loads don't trigger unnecessary imports
- [ ] Test with empty database to ensure proper initialization
- [ ] Test with existing data to ensure no duplication

## Development Build Creation

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Verify all dependencies are installed
- [ ] Check for any TypeScript errors that might prevent building
- [ ] Ensure the build scripts are properly configured

### Build Process
- [ ] Run the build process for the web application
- [ ] Address any build errors or warnings
- [ ] Verify the build output is correct
- [ ] Test the built application in a browser

### Deployment
- [ ] Set up a simple deployment process for testing
- [ ] Deploy the application to a test environment
- [ ] Verify the deployed application works correctly
- [ ] Document the deployment process

## Known Issues to Address

- [ ] Fix the issue with repeated data import on application load
- [ ] Ensure Mass, Divine Office, and Prayers pages display correctly
- [ ] Fix any navigation issues between pages
- [ ] Address any UI/UX inconsistencies

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Implement a more user-friendly import process with progress indicators
- [ ] Add data validation during import
- [ ] Implement error recovery for failed imports
- [ ] Add support for incremental updates to the database
