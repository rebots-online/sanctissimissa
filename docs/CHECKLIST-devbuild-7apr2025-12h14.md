# Development Build Checklist - April 7, 2025

## Overview

This checklist outlines the specific, granular steps to achieve a working development build of the Sanctissi-Missa application, prioritizing functionality over optimization.

## Status Key

- `[ ]` - Not yet begun / Placeholder
- `[/]` - Started but incomplete
- `[X]` - Completed but not thoroughly tested / Needs verification against standards
- `✅` - Tested and complete according to all documented standards

## Phase 1: Minimal Viable Build Preparation

### Environment Setup
- [X] Verify Node.js and npm installation
- [X] Confirm EAS CLI is properly installed and configured
- [X] Check for any uncommitted changes that might affect the build
- [X] Ensure all required dependencies are installed with `npm install`

### Critical Code Adjustments
- [X] Add minimal error handling to PrerenderedContent.getDay() to prevent crashes
  ```typescript
  static async getDay(date: string): Promise<PrerenderedDay | null> {
    try {
      const key = `${this.STORAGE_PREFIX}${date}`;
      const data = await AsyncStorage.getItem(key);
      return data ? JSON.parse(data) : null;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to get prerendered day:', error);
      return null; // Return null instead of throwing error
    }
  }
  ```

- [X] Add fallback in DataManager.getMassProper() to handle AsyncStorage failures
  ```typescript
  async getMassProper(date: string = format(new Date(), 'yyyy-MM-dd')): Promise<MassProper> {
    try {
      // Try to get pre-rendered content first
      try {
        const prerendered = await PrerenderedContent.getDay(date);
        if (prerendered?.mass) {
          return prerendered.mass as unknown as MassProper;
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error retrieving prerendered content:', error);
        // Continue to fallback method
      }

      // If not pre-rendered or error occurred, generate on demand
      const dayInfo = LiturgicalCalendar.getDayInfo(date);
      return await LiturgicalTexts.getMassProper(dayInfo);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to get Mass proper:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
  ```

- [X] Add try/catch block in PrerenderedContent.initialize() to prevent app crashes
  ```typescript
  static async initialize(): Promise<void> {
    try {
      // Check if today is prerendered
      const today = format(new Date(), 'yyyy-MM-dd');
      const content = await this.getDay(today);
      
      if (!content) {
        // Prerender today and tomorrow
        await this.prerenderWeek(today);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to initialize PrerenderedContent:', error);
      // Don't throw error, just log it
    }
  }
  ```

- [X] Add error handling to other AsyncStorage-related methods
  - Added error handling to DataManager.getOfficeHour()
  - Added error handling to DataManager.getDayInfo()
  - Added error handling to DataManager.clearCache()
  - Added error handling to PrerenderedContent.prerenderWeek()
  - Added error handling to PrerenderedContent.prerenderDay()
  - Added error handling to PrerenderedContent.clearOldContent()

### Build Configuration
- [X] Verify eas.json has correct development profile settings
- [X] Ensure build-dev.sh script has execute permissions
- [X] Check that package.json has the correct build scripts

## Phase 2: Build Execution

### Pre-build Verification
- [X] Run TypeScript type checking with `npm run type-check`
- [/] Run ESLint checks with `npm run lint`
- [✅] Fix any critical errors that would prevent the build (TypeScript errors found)

### TypeScript Error Fixes (See TYPESCRIPT-FIXES-7apr2025.md)
- [✅] Fix component prop type errors in AccordionSection and SearchBar
- [✅] Fix navigation type errors in HomeScreen
- [✅] Add missing static properties in LiturgicalCalendar
- [✅] Add missing module declarations for expo-print and expo-sharing
- [✅] Fix SQLite API compatibility issues

### Build Process
- [X] Execute the build script with `./scripts/build-dev.sh`
- [X] Monitor the build process for errors
- [X] Address any build failures immediately

### Build Output
- [✅] Verify the APK file is generated
- [✅] Check the build logs for warnings or errors
- [✅] Save the build URL for installation (https://expo.dev/accounts/robinsaiworld/projects/sanctissi-missa/builds/5fcf9ee6-9a5f-4080-b6be-ca9ceb5cb6d4)

## Phase 3: Minimal Testing

### Installation
- [/] Install the APK on the Z-Fold device (Build URL: https://expo.dev/accounts/robinsaiworld/projects/sanctissi-missa/builds/5fcf9ee6-9a5f-4080-b6be-ca9ceb5cb6d4)
- [ ] Verify the app launches without crashing
- [ ] Check that the UI renders correctly

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Test navigation between screens
- [ ] Verify the calendar data loads
- [ ] Check that the Latin day name displays correctly
- [ ] Test basic content loading

### Error Handling
- [ ] Document any errors that occur during testing
- [ ] Identify critical issues that need immediate fixing
- [ ] Create a list of non-critical issues for future sprints

## Phase 4: Incremental Improvements (Post-MVP)

### Error Handling Enhancements
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the app
- [ ] Add user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Create recovery mechanisms for data loading failures

### AsyncStorage Optimizations
- [ ] Optimize storage operations for better performance
- [ ] Implement storage size limits
- [ ] Add cache management features

### UI Refinements
- [ ] Improve UI for foldable devices
- [ ] Enhance responsiveness across different screen configurations
- [ ] Add loading indicators for long operations

## Daily Progress Tracking

| Date | Completed Tasks | Blockers | Next Steps |
|------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| 2025-04-07 (AM) | Created development build plan and checklist; Implemented error handling improvements for AsyncStorage operations; Enhanced eas.json configuration; Identified TypeScript errors | TypeScript compilation errors | Fix TypeScript errors before proceeding with build |
| 2025-04-07 (PM) | Fixed all TypeScript errors: component prop types, navigation types, missing static properties, module declarations, and SQLite API compatibility issues | None | Proceed with build execution |

## Notes

- This checklist prioritizes getting a working build over optimization
- Focus on minimal changes needed to ensure the app loads and functions
- Document issues for future improvement rather than trying to fix everything at once
- The goal is a minimally functional development build that can be incrementally improved
- All TypeScript errors have been fixed:
  - ✅ Component prop type errors in AccordionSection and SearchBar
  - ✅ Navigation type errors in HomeScreen
  - ✅ Missing static properties in LiturgicalCalendar
  - ✅ Missing module declarations for expo-print and expo-sharing
  - ✅ SQLite API compatibility issues
