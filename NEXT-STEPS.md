# SanctissiMissa Next Steps

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented the following components of the SanctissiMissa web application:

1. **Project Setup**:
   - Initialized React + TypeScript project with Vite
   - Configured Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Set up project structure (components, services, models)
   - Configured routing with React Router
   - Created comprehensive project documentation

2. **Liturgical Calendar**:
   - Implemented Easter date calculation algorithm
   - Created liturgical day models and interfaces
   - Implemented basic liturgical calendar service
   - Created calendar page with date navigation
   - Implemented liturgical day display component

3. **Documentation**:
   - Created ARCHITECTURE.md with detailed system design
   - Created ROADMAP.md with development phases
   - Created IDEOLOGY.md with project principles
   - Created implementation guides for database and calendar

## Current Challenges

We encountered some issues with the database implementation:

1. **Database Setup**: We attempted to set up the IndexedDB database using the idb library, but encountered issues with file creation and access.

2. **Tool Interruptions**: Some tool calls were interrupted or canceled, making it difficult to complete the database implementation.

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for continuing the development are:

### 1. Complete Database Implementation

- Create the database schema and initialization code in `web-app/src/services/database/db.ts`
- Implement data access layers for each store (liturgical days, mass texts, office texts, prayers, journal entries)
- Create data import service for loading liturgical texts
- Add database initialization to application startup

Follow the detailed instructions in the DATABASE-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md file.

### 2. Implement Mass Texts Display

- Create Mass text models and interfaces
- Implement Mass text retrieval service
- Design Mass text display components
- Create Mass page with proper and ordinary texts
- Add rubrics and explanations

### 3. Implement Divine Office Display

- Create Divine Office models and interfaces
- Implement hour selection (Matins, Lauds, etc.)
- Design Office text display components
- Create Office page with psalms, readings, etc.
- Add proper antiphons and prayers

### 4. Add Prayer Texts

- Create prayer models and interfaces
- Implement prayer category organization
- Add Rosary prayers and mysteries
- Add Divine Mercy Chaplet
- Add other traditional prayers

### 5. Implement User Journal

- Create journal entry model and interface
- Implement journal entry creation and editing
- Add audio recording functionality
- Create journal entry listing and filtering
- Add tagging and categorization

## Notes for Implementation

1. **Database Structure**: The database schema is designed to store liturgical texts in a structured way, with separate stores for liturgical days, Mass texts, Office texts, prayers, and user journal entries.

2. **Calendar Calculation**: The liturgical calendar calculation is complex and requires careful implementation of the Easter algorithm, season boundaries, and precedence rules.

3. **User Interface**: The UI should be clean, responsive, and focused on the liturgical texts, with easy navigation between different parts of the liturgy.

4. **Offline Support**: The application should work fully offline, with all necessary data stored in IndexedDB.

5. **Performance**: Pay attention to performance, especially when loading and displaying large texts like the Divine Office.
