# SanctissiMissa Project Ideology

## Mission

SanctissiMissa aims to provide a comprehensive, accessible, and faithful digital resource for Catholics who wish to participate in the traditional liturgy of the Church (Extraordinary Form). Our mission is to make the rich liturgical heritage of the Catholic Church available to all, free of charge, with a focus on both accuracy and usability.

## Core Values

### 1. Liturgical Fidelity

We are committed to absolute fidelity to the traditional liturgical texts and rubrics of the Catholic Church. All texts, translations, and instructions are based on authoritative sources and follow the 1962 Missale Romanum and related liturgical books. We prioritize accuracy and authenticity in all liturgical content.

### 2. Accessibility and Inclusivity

We believe that the traditional liturgy should be accessible to all Catholics, regardless of their background, experience, or neurodivergence. We design our application with clear explanations, intuitive navigation, and supportive features to help users understand and participate in the liturgy more fully.

### 3. Digital Excellence

We strive for technical excellence in our implementation, using modern web technologies to create a responsive, reliable, and performant application. We prioritize offline functionality, privacy, and security to ensure that users can access liturgical texts anywhere, anytime, without concerns about data usage or connectivity.

### 4. Educational Depth

Beyond merely providing liturgical texts, we aim to foster deeper understanding of the liturgy through educational content, conceptual explanations, and historical context. We believe that understanding the "why" behind liturgical actions enhances participation and spiritual growth.

### 5. Community Without Compromise

We foster a spirit of community among traditional Catholics while maintaining respect for the Church's teachings and traditions. We value mutual respect and love of neighbor over rigid rule-following, recognizing that the liturgy is meant to sanctify and unite the faithful.

## Design Principles

### 1. Content First

The liturgical texts and prayers are the primary focus of our application. Design decisions prioritize the clear presentation and usability of these texts above all else.

### 2. Progressive Disclosure

We present information in layers, allowing users to access basic functionality immediately while providing deeper levels of detail and customization for those who need it.

### 3. Respectful Aesthetics

Our visual design reflects the dignity and beauty of the traditional liturgy without unnecessary ornamentation that might distract from the content.

### 4. Thoughtful Defaults

We provide sensible defaults that work for most users while allowing customization for specific needs or preferences.

### 5. Offline-First

We design our application to work fully offline, ensuring that users can access liturgical texts even without an internet connection.

## Project Governance

### 1. Free and Open

SanctissiMissa is and will remain completely free to use. We are committed to making the traditional liturgy accessible to all without financial barriers.

### 2. User-Centered Development

We prioritize user needs and feedback in our development process, focusing on solving real problems and enhancing the liturgical experience of our users.

### 3. Sustainable Growth

We plan for sustainable, incremental development that builds on a solid foundation rather than rushing to add features at the expense of quality or stability.

### 4. Collaborative Approach

We welcome contributions from those who share our values and vision, fostering a collaborative environment that respects both tradition and innovation.

### 5. Educational Mission

We see our project as part of a broader educational mission to help Catholics understand and appreciate the traditional liturgy, especially those who may be encountering it for the first time.

## Conclusion

SanctissiMissa is more than just an appâ€”it's a digital ministry dedicated to preserving and promoting the traditional liturgical heritage of the Catholic Church. By combining liturgical fidelity with modern technology, we hope to make the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite more accessible and understandable to Catholics around the world, fostering deeper participation in the sacred mysteries of our faith.
